So on the left hand side of IAM

there are the roles and roles are used

to grant permissions to entities that you trust.

And some of these are AWS services within your account.

So let's go ahead and create a role.

So we're going to create a role right here

and this will be a role for an AWS service

but you can see you have other options

that are out of scope right now.

So this Institute service can be a lot of things.

As you can see, all these services

in this UI can use roles so you can create

the role for pretty much everything

but a very common use case to create a role

are EC2 instances and Lambda functions.

EC2 instances are virtual servers

and Lambda function, trans run code.

But don't worry, we'll get to those when

we go in their respective sections.

So let's use an EC2 instance.

We're going to create an easy two instance role.

So I click on easy two and then click on next permissions.

And here we're able to say

what is our EC2 instance going to be able to do?

And for example, I can attach a permission

permission to my role and say, you can get.

I am read only access to the role, I click on tags.

We can tag this role, but we won't do so.

Click on review and electorate demo,

role for EC2.

And that's it.

I will go ahead and create the role.

Now we won't be using this role just right now

but as you can see the role is created under

the role section. And if I click on this role

I can see it has the, I am read only access permission.

We'll get back to this role.

When we go into the EC2 section, which is the next section.
