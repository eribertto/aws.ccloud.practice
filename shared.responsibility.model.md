Now again,

one more reminder into the Shared Responsibility Model

and how this applies for EC2.

So AWS is going to be responsible for all data centers,

their infrastructure and the security of them,

then AWS is going to be responsible

for making sure you have isolation on the physical host,

if you're getting,

for example, a dedicated host or replacing faulty hardware

if one of their servers is failing,

or making sure they are still compliant with the regulations

that they have agreed to.

But you as a user,

you're responsible for the security in the cloud.

So that means that you define your own security group rules.

And this allows you or other people to access

or not your EC2 instances.

You own the entire virtual machine

inside of your EC2 instance.

So that means that your operating system will be Windows

or Linux, all the patches and the updates.

You have to do them not AWS.

AWS will give you the virtual machine.

It's up to you to handle it the way you want.

That means that all the software

and the utilities that are installed on this EC2 instance,

also are yours to be responsible for.

Finally, understanding how to assign AM Roles

and make sure the permissions are correct.

And finally, making sure data is secure on your instance

is also very important for your EC2 instances.

So that's it.

Hope that again puts a bit of perspective

on to the shared responsibility model for EC2

and I will see you in the next lecture.
