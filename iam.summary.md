So here is a summary for IAM.

We've seen IAM users and they should be mapped

to an actual physical user within your company.

And this user will have a password for the AWS console.

Now we can group these users into groups

and therefore users only.

We can attach policies

or share JSON documents that outline the permission

for users or groups.

And we can also create roles

and these roles will be identities, but this time

for maybe EC2 instances or other AWS services.

We assume that for security

we can enable multi-factor authentication so MFA

and also set a password policy for our users.

We can use the CLI to manage your services

using the command line

or the SDK to manage your AWS services,

using a programming language.

Finally, we can create access keys to access AWS

using the CLI or the SDK.

And finally, we can audit our IAM usage

by creating an IAM credentials report

and also using the IAM access advisor service.

So that's it for this lecture.

I hope you liked it.

And I will see you in the next lecture.
