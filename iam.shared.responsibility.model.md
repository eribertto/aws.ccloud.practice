Throughout the CCP exam, you are going

to get a lot of questions on something called

Shared Responsibility Model.

And this is to ensure that you know

what AWS is responsible for,

and what you are responsible for.

Now, I want to include some bits of information

within some sections to give you an idea of how

the shared responsibility model works for AWs.

So AWS is responsible for everything

that they do, for example, their infrastructure

and their global network security,

the configuration and vulnerabilty analysis

of the services they offer,

and any sign of compliance

that they are responsible for.

But regarding IAM, you are responsible for a lot

of things that AWS will not do for you.

You are responsible for creating your own users,

your groups, your roles, your policies,

the management of these policies,

and the monitoring of that.

You are responsible for enabling MFA

on all accounts and enforcing this, not AWS.

You are also responsible to make sure

that the keys are rotated often.

You need to make sure that you use the IAM tools

to apply the appropriate permissions,

and again, you are responsible

for analyzing the access patterns

and review the permissions in your accounts,

not AWS.

So this is a very simple example,

but an obvious one. But AWS is responsible

for all the infrastructure,

and you are responsible for how you use

that infrastructure.

This is just one of these lectures

on shared responsibility.

I hope you liked it,

and I will see you in the next lecture.
